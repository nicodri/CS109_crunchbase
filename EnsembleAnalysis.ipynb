    "As investors we want to know which companies will succeed and which companies will fail so we can make smart investments.  Unfortuanetly there is no way to know ahead of time which companies will succeed or fauk, however, we can try to predict success based on the huge amounts of data available online about startups.  For this project we will be analyzing data obtained through the [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CrunchBase dataset, while extensive provides us with data that is pretty biased.  In order to be in the CrunchBase database, a company must already have become newsworthy.  Normally that means raising a significant round of funding or graduating from a prominent incubator.  We will take this bias into account when performing our analysis.  Simply raising one round of funding will not be considered a succesful outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how will we define success?  We will use a couple of indicators, and if a company achieves even a single one of these, we will consider the startup to be successful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So what are the indicators we are using? We will consider a company to be a success if it IPOs or if it is acquired (even though we are aware that many acquisitions may not be considered successes by employees or investors in a company, for this project we will be making this simplification and assuming all acquisitions are successes).  We will also consider a startup a success if it has raised several rounds of funding.  How many?  Well, since all the startups in the CrunchBase database have already raised one round, we will pretend we are making a second round investment.  Any companies that raise a thrid round will be considered succesful as they have proven that other investors are interested in investing in this company after us.  Later we will show another reason why we chose 3 as a cutoff in the number of rounds of investment to be considered successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all companies are equally successful.  And perhaps it is best to weight your investments based on how certain you are that a company will succeed and how succesful that company will be, in terms of what the rate of return for a particular company is.  However, since we don't have all of the financial information for funding rounds, and none of the financial information for rate of return for different investors in different rounds of different companies, we will simply focus in this project on the overall success or failure of a company and treat this as a classification problem, rather than a regression problem."
