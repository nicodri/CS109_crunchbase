In 2012, she starred in her own BRAVO tv documentary series (aka reality show), something she now describes as \"a rather unpleasant, oddly fascinating, very unlikely bootcamp for the soul.\"\r\n\r\nAllison got her start in journalism as a columnist for Georgetown University when she was an undergraduate; to date she has published over 400 articles for publications as diverse as The New York Times, ELLE, Newsweek, New York Magazine, The Guardian and Cosmopolitan, covering everything from Burning Man to Comic Con to New York Fashion Week to the White House Correspondents' Dinner.\r\n\r\nAs one of the new millennium\u2019s gonzo journalists, she wrote a long running column for Time Out New York, a love column for ELLE magazine and an internationally syndicated technology column for Tribune Media Services. She is one of only a handful of women ever to be featured on the cover of WIRED magazine - at age 27 - representing a new generation of innovative journalism and personal branding.\r\n\r\nShe has spoken at MIT, Wharton, Harvard, and at numerous conferences around the world about the human potential movement, new media, innovation, entrepreneurship, transformational culture, creativity and happiness. She has advised C-level executives & co-founders at Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr, companies such as Sony, Intel, Cisco, Radioshack and a dozen or so startups like About.me, mainly with regard to high level press strategy and media training their executives.\r\n\r\nA recovering social media addict with over 400k combined Facebook and Twitter followers, she\u2019s lived in New York, LA, San Francisco, Chicago and Washington, DC, where she worked on Capitol Hill as the youngest full time legislative staff member in the 107th Congress for then-Congressman (now Senator) Mark Kirk.\r\n\r\nAfter a decade of forging a more \u201ctraditional\u201d media career path, five years ago she went totally gonzo, sent herself to an ashram, and from there embarked upon an extensive series of over 200 transformational experiments - from Native American sweat lodges to ecstatic dance to ayahuasca with a shaman in Peru - ultimately becoming an outspoken evangelist for the human potential movement. \r\n\r\nHer life mission is to be an exuberant force for good, opening people\u2019s hearts to deeper connection with one another, inspiring them to greater heights in their creative self-expression and galvanizing them to lead a life of meaning, inquiry, self-discovery and service to their own unique path and purpose. \r\n\r\nAllison currently lives in San Francisco\u2019s Marina neighborhood, where she relishes being a social alchemist and bridge builder amongst disparate groups of brilliant and motivated change makers - from artists to scientists to healers to technologists - encouraging them to collaborate on how to evolve their own lives - and ultimately the consciousness of the planet.", "permalink": "julia-allison", "born_on": "1981-02-28"}], "founders": [{"bio": "Tony Conrad is co-founder and CEO of [about.me](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/aboutme) (acquired by Aol in December 2010 and bought back by the founders in February 2013), the platform for representing personal identity online.

During his postdoctoral work, he discovered a new principle of ligand sorting in membrane trafficking and was the first to apply a systematic, multi-parameter RNA interference screen in human cells to compare the role of the human complement of kinases in two viral entry pathways via caveolae/raft- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, Dr. Pelkmans applied computational approaches for quantitative analysis of membrane trafficking events recorded with total internal reflection microscopy, revealing kiss-and-run recycling of individual caveolae in epithelial cells and the role of some kinases in recycling dynamics and caveolae coat stability. Dr. Pelkmans is recognized for pioneering the Systems Biology approach to identify host genes required for viral infection. He was awarded an Independent Research Professorship from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) (February 2005) and the European Young Investigator (EURYI) (August 2005), having earlier been awarded the ETH medal for his PhD thesis. He spent two years as an EMBO long-term Fellow and Marie Curie Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, Germany.

To imagine a single person that starts with a simple idea and then turns that idea into a permanent monument of human accomplishment - that is beautiful. To imagine a single human being having the guts to hold themselves responsible for affecting so many lives through employment, through their product and through the shear, raw, and direct power of money - that is my kind of benevolence. To see a person stand up and attempt greatness in the face of such overwhelming mediocrity in today's world - that is courage.\r\n\r\nI have seen the best and the worst that being an entrepreneur can offer. I've seen revenues grew from $20 million to over $3.6 billion. I've ridden the roller coaster of going public seeing our stock rise by 856% only to come crashing back down by 900%. I've taken on Google at their height of power and convinced 72 other to join me. I've made many decisions that made people love me, but more importantly I made a few difficult calls that I knew were right even though I knew it would make some hate me. Regardless of the perils, the risks and the loneliness that entrepreneurs often face, I know that my path is to create, to build and to take something that perhaps only I can see and make it work. It is ingrained my bones and my heart. I am a capitalist and I am an entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nTo me, there is hardly anything more difficult, more worthy or more inspiring than being a founder.  What defines us is that despite the risks, the fears and the fact that almost all who try fail, we, by our own volition, start companies with the intent of changing the world.  And we do so not as the consumers or dependancies of the initial spark that ultimately creates value, but rather as the producers, the irreducible primaries, of it.  As such, our evolutionary path, our successes and our failures, not only affects us, but also radiates out to the entire startup ecosystem with which we share co-dependencies.\r\n\r\nYet, despite the importance of our quest, our path is rarely made easier by our own kind.  We, the founder cognoscenti, are so rapt with our own efforts that we rarely lift our head, or rather our minds to help our own brethren.  We, the great producers of value, seem to flip becoming the consumer of knowledge rather than the producer of it.  As a result, we unwittingly end up stifling our brethren instead of helping them in ways that seem obvious. \r\n\r\nWhile founders may have no formal leader, no formal structure and our borders may be unbound by geography, doctrine or rules, we are, in fact, a community.  To create a shared sense of our current state through the fearless act of sharing knowledge or taking a position is what binds us together.  To do so declares our state and consummates our union.  To repudiate such an attempt abdicates our responsibility to one another, contradicts our nature as producers and inures us to a solitary existence where we set ourselves adrift in what is already tempestuous waters.\r\n\r\nIn a world which irrationally values quips over explanations, summation over detail, kind of getting it versus really getting it, it is essential to recognize the need for depth when depth is necessary.  So however long, flawed or perilous my essays and writings may be, and even though my wife has grave concerns for the english language when put in my hands, if just one founder is able to extract a single shred of knowledge that completes a circuit, then it was worth it.", "permalink": "steve-newcomb", "born_on": null}, {"bio": "Justin Yoshimura is an entrepreneur and angel investor.

This would lead to the founding of reddit, which he recounted along with many lessons for entrepreneurs, in his national bestseller, Without Their Permission.\r\n\r\nAt UVA, Alexis majored in business and history with a minor in German. Though he had originally planned to become an immigration lawyer, he experienced an epiphany in his junior year (while sitting in a Waffle House) that led him to the realization that he didn't want to practice law. Instead he convinced his best friend Steve to start a company with him.\r\nThe pair traveled to Cambridge, MA during their senior year spring break to hear Paul Graham give a talk titled \"How to Start a Startup.\" After the lecture, Alexis invited Graham out for a drink so he and Steve could pitch Graham on their business idea. Graham agreed, loved the idea, and suggested they apply to a new seed stage venture firm he'd launched called Y Combinator.\r\nAlexis and Steve's original plan was to build an infrastructure that would allow people to order food from their cell phones. Though the idea was rejected, Alexis and Steve were invited to join the first class of Y Combinator, on the condition that they'd come up with a new concept. The next idea they pitched to Graham would become reddit.com.\r\n\r\nSixteen months after he graduated, reddit was acquired by Cond\u00e9 Nast. Alexis continued to manage product and business at reddit until leaving in 2010 to volunteer in Armenia for Kiva.org. Today he sits on the board of reddit, which last month alone had over 170 million unique visitors and is one of the 10 biggest US websites.\r\n\r\nAfter working as a Kiva Fellow in Yerevan for three months, Alexis returned to the US to focus on a social enterprise he'd started called Breadpig. Described as a \"sidekick-for-hire,\" Breadpig publishes books featuring some of the most popular webcomics in the world, xkcd & Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, and produces other geeky novelties like Awesomesauce and LOLmagnetz. It also provides services for people who want to make something nice, or take a risk on something crazy. The non-sustainable profits are donated to worthy causes (over $200,000 so far!).\r\n\r\nUpon returning to the States, Alexis also accepted a position as Y Combinator's Ambassador to the East. He\u2019d later become a partner at Y Combinator.\r\nIn August 2010, just weeks before the launch, Alexis joined the team at hipmunk, Steve Huffman's second Y Combinator startup. Alexis helped create the company's brand identity and managed their marketing and PR. After a little over a year, Alexis moved to an advisory role and accepted an offer from Grand Central Publishing for his first book, Without Their Permission: How the 21st Century Will Be Made not Managed, which debuted as a national bestseller.\r\n\r\nIn early November 2011, Alexis joined the fight against SOPA and PIPA, becoming one of the public faces for the movement, which ultimately thwarted both bills in a display of citizen power never seen before by lawmakers. He continues to fight for internet freedom working on projects like the Declaration of Internet Freedom, Internet Defense League, and the Internet 2012 Campaign Bus Tour, which toured the heartland of America with Erik Martin to campaign for the open internet and produced a documentary about the adventure, Silicon Prairie. He also sat on the NYC Mayor's Council on Tech and Innovation under the Bloomberg Administration.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, he launched a show on The Verge called Small Empires, which ran for two seasons, taking viewers on a \u201cNo Reservations\u201d style look inside tech startups across North America -- the founders who create and the people who use these digital platforms.\r\n\r\nAn active investor with over one hundred tech startups in his portfolio, Alexis is now one of the most prominent investors in tech. He designed the logos and brands for reddit, Breadpig, and hipmunk, and he has proven the model for making something people love online & offline, building brands that are both community-driven (reddit) and not (hipmunk). He uses these experiences to mentor and advise the young startups in his portfolio and recent Y Combinator graduates.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Alexis has spoken at TED (a talk viewed over a million times), been rendered in CGI on NMA.TV, was named to the Forbes30 Under 30 in Technology two years in a row (and then turned 30), and included in Inc. Magazine's 30 under 30 for his work at hipmunk. He's a regular contributor on Bloomberg TV and is especially proud of unlocking his bucket-list achievement - appearing on The Colbert Report.\r\n\r\nAlexis has spoken at over eighty universities including Harvard, MIT, Yale, Carnegie Mellon, Princeton, U Penn, NYU, Columbia, UCLA, the University of Michigan, the University of Edinburgh, and the University of Virginia to name a few.

While primarily known for its investments in seed and early stage technology companies, Lowercase has quietly become one of the largest momentum investment funds in the country.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Chris served as Head of Special Initiatives at Google Inc. In that role, among other responsibilities, he founded and headed up the alternative access and wireless divisions. His most visible projects include Google's 700MHz and TV white spaces spectrum initiatives, the company's groundbreaking data center in Oregon and Google's free citywide WiFi network in Mountain View, CA. Chris also spearheaded many of Google's business development and M&A transactions and was on the founding team of the company's New Business Development organization.\r\n\r\nBefore joining Google, Chris held a number of executive roles at one of the world's largest streaming and digital media distribution companies, Speedera Networks (acquired by Akamai Technologies), and was ultimately responsible for their legal and corporate development efforts. \r\n\r\nPrior to Speedera, Chris was an attorney with the Silicon Valley law firm of Fenwick & West where he handled venture capital, mergers & acquisitions, and licensing transactions for technology clients such as Macromedia, VeriSign, and Kleiner Perkins. In 2008, Chris proudly worked on President Barack Obama's campaign as a Telecommunications, Media, and Technology advisor, a speaking surrogate, a field office volunteer, and as Co-Chair of Finance and a Trustee of the Presidential Inaugural Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Wall Street Journal cited Chris as \"possibly the most influential businessman in America\" and Chris was the youngest member of the Forbes 2011 Midas List. Chris is a fixture in the Silicon Valley startup community, and as a result of his reputation for fruitful and fun collaborations with early stage companies he was named as one of the top 10 angel investors in the country by Business Week.\r\n\r\nChris was recently recognized as a Henry Crown Fellow of the Aspen Institute, annually selecting 20 of the world's most promising leaders and public servants under the age of 45 and he also serves as an Associate Fellow of the Said Business School at Oxford University. \r\n\r\nChris regularly appears on television, radio, and in print and has been featured in Business Week, Fortune, Fast Company, and on CNBC, BBC, CNN, FOX, and NPR as an expert in the realms of entrepreneurism, venture capital, and disruptive technologies. In parallel with his frequent keynotes at technology industry events, Chris is perennially hired by many of the world's largest companies, financial institutions, universities, and governments to speak about innovation, workplace design, and business strategy in a digital era. \r\n\r\nChris graduated cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center where he was a member of The Tax Lawyer law review and was honored as the school's Philip A. Ryan and Ralph J. Gilbert Memorial Scholar. He also graduated cum laude from the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and was an Edmund Evans Memorial Scholar as well as a Weeks Family Foundation Scholar. \r\n\r\nDuring his studies, Chris attended university at each of Universidad Cat\u00c3\u00b3lica del Ecuador in Quito, Ecuador, University College Cork, in Cork, Ireland, and the Universidad Complutense in Madrid, Spain. Long before that, beginning in 6th grade, Chris attended the State University of New York at Buffalo for six years of graduate- level mathematics classes wearing thick glasses, awkward braces, and knowing the entire time that technology and computers would be passions of his for life.\r\n\r\nAlways taught by his parents the importance of giving back to those who need our help, Chris dedicates much of his time to helping charity:water and Lance Armstrong's LIVESTRONG Foundation and, if you spend any time with him, he will likely rope you into doing your part as well. \r\n\r\nWhen not on the road for his companies, or huddled up in the cramped apartments and coffeeshops where his entrepreneurs often write their code, Chris lives in Truckee, California, is an avid Pacifica surfer, San Mateo kitesurfer, Lake Tahoe skier, two-time Ironman triathlete, and he recently bicycled coast-to-coast across the United States of America.", "permalink": "chris-sacca", "born_on": null}], "founders": [{"bio": "Francisco Tolmasky is a coufounder at [280 North](/company/280-North) and is the original author of Objective-J.

He founded Achates Power, Inc. in 2004 with an idea that would revolutionize the automotive industry by revitalizing the opposed-piston, two-stroke engine. As an influential physicist holding more than 100 patents, Lemke understood the rapidly increasing shortage of fuel and greater need for emissions reduction meant the world needed a solution. That solution came in a 1930s-era engine architecture that demonstrated great potential but momentum had dissipated when the tools of the time could not produce an efficient version. Lemke knew the tools and the talent were now available to answer the transportation crisis. He started Achates Power with a collection of the brightest engineers and scientists with the condition that ideas and discourse flow unabated and the expectation that each fulfill their utmost potential. While amassing top talent in the industry, Lemke's vision began to manifest results. However, instead of an engine that only moderately answered the need for efficiency, the Achates Power engine realized a more than 20 percent fuel efficiency improvement compared to the industry's best medium-duty diesel engine (approximately 55 percent more fuel efficient than a standard gasoline engine) at lower emissions levels and at 10 percent lower cost. While Lemke always believed in the engine's viability, now the results have shown the industry the potential economic savings of trillions of dollars per year on fuel and components, and billions of gallons of fuel saved per year.\r\n\r\nPrior to starting Achates Power, Lemke was the CEO and founder of Spin Physics, Inc., which developed and patented magnetic recording transducers that employ unique magnetic materials instrumental to broadcast TV recording. At one time 50 percent of the broadcast hours on television worldwide were recorded on Spin Physics' magnetic heads. Lemke sold the company to Eastman Kodak and became a fellow of the Kodak Research Labs. Earlier in his career Lemke was the research director of Bell and Howell Research, as well as an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego. He holds more than 100 patents with the U.S. patent office. Lemke is a member of the National Academy of Engineering as well as a fellow of both the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Lemke earned a bachelor's degree in physics from the Illinois Institute of Technology, a master's degree in physics from Northwestern University and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara.

the biggest problems the world is facing as opportunities for creativity and solutions,\" says Paul Matteucci. \r\n\r\nWith a passion for creating jobs and mentoring startup teams, Paul has helped a generation of entrepreneurs learn object lessons in how to execute during difficult times. In fact, he notes, the best of them learn to use hard times as a source for innovation, and as impetus for creating cultures that are accountable, cash-efficient and focused. \"When someone from this generation loses a job, you are almost as likely to find them waiting in the lobbies of venture capital firms with a business plan as in the unemployment line with a resume. The people we meet have a sense that they can take charge of their own destiny, rather than become a victim of their circumstance.\"\r\nAt USVP, Paul has led or co-led investments in 3Ware (sold to AMCC), Total Beauty, Trovix (sold to Monster), PlaceIQ, Swoop, and others. He has also served on the board of Homestead (sold to Intuit) and was an Angel Investor in Fra' Mani, a sustainable food producer. During his early tenure at USVP, Paul served as interim CEO of several of the firm's portfolio companies. \"We saved some and we lost some but, as a firm, we always remain willing to do the heavy lifting to make our companies successful.\" \r\n\r\nPrior to USVP, Paul was CEO of HearMe, taking that company public in 1998. His two decades of operating experience include eight years with Adaptec, where he was Vice President and General Manager of the SCSI storage and connectivity division leading the business to over a quarter billion in revenues, before turning it over to a team he hired and mentored. Upon leaving Adaptec, Paul served as a Resident Entrepreneur for Institutional Venture Partners in 1995 and was an advisor to Accel Partners, Redpoint Ventures and Sutter Hill Ventures in the 1990s. \r\n\r\nPaul earned an M.B.A. from Stanford University, an M.A. in International Studies from Johns Hopkins and a B.A. from the University of the Pacific. \r\n\r\nHe serves as a trustee of the World Affairs Council and is a board member of the University of the Pacific's School of International Studies and of the Business School at Montana State University in Bozeman. He is a frequent lecturer at business schools, including Notre Dame, University of Minnesota, Montana State and U.C. Davis. \r\n\r\nPaul's current interests on the technology landscape include: Internet-based services, data analytics, mobile computing, audience measurement and aggregation, data storage and rethinking the industrial food system. \"The demographic models point to a peaking of the world's population below ten billion by 2050. Getting from here to there without massive starvation and environmental damage is a major challenge for governments and businesses. But it is also an enormous opportunity for entrepreneurs, with creative ideas, to build valuable companies that address this issue.\" He and his family have founded \"Feeding 10 Billion\", a non-profit resource center for food system entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\nOn the natural landscape: \"Building an American Serengeti\"-- an ambitious undertaking Paul is pursuing with the American Prairie Foundation (APF), to recreate and preserve three million acres of the nation's prairie lands. \r\n\r\nA grandson of Italian immigrants, Paul followed his heritage from San Francisco to Florence, Italy, where he attended cooking school. He blended his passions for cooking and the environment into a series of fundraising dinners for APF--\"Lewis and Clark: Cooking of the Jeffersonian Era.\" Checkout his website and blog at www.foodcrunch.com . \r\n\r\nFavorite Books: A River Runs Through It by Norman MacLean, because \"it reminded me of growing up with my father and brother,\" and The Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan, which describes how industrial food is destroying our health and our planet.", "permalink": "paul-matteucci", "born_on": null}, {"bio": "Stuart Nagae joined Vulcan Capital in 2002 and is a Partner in the Venture Capital group.

In 1976, she moved to Baltimore's WJZ-TV to co-anchor the six o'clock news.\r\n\r\nIn January 1984, Winfrey moved to Chicago to host \"A.M. Chicago\" for WLS-TV. In less than a year, the show expanded to one hour and was renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show. It entered national syndication in 1986, becoming the highest-rated talk show in television history. In 1988, she established Harpo Studios, a production facility in Chicago, making her the third woman in the American entertainment industry (after Mary Pickford and Lucille Ball) to own her own studio.\r\n\r\nA year later, The Oprah Winfrey Show was broadcast nationally, and quickly became the number one talk show in national syndication. In 1987, its first year of eligibility, the show received three Daytime Emmy Awards in the categories of Outstanding Host, Outstanding Talk/Service Program and Outstanding Direction. The following year, the show received its second consecutive Emmy as Outstanding Talk/Service Program, and Oprah herself received the International Radio and Television Society's \"Broadcaster of the Year\" Award. She was the youngest person ever to receive the honor. \r\n\r\nOprah made her acting debut in 1985, when she starred in Steven Spielberg's 'The Color Purple'. Her performance in the film earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and nominations for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.\r\n\r\ner love of acting and her desire to bring quality entertainment projects into production prompted her to form her own production company, Harpo Productions, Inc., in 1986. Today, Harpo is a formidable force in film and television production, as well as magazine publishing and the Internet. In 1988, Harpo Productions, Inc. acquired ownership and all production responsibilities for The Oprah Winfrey Show from Capitol Cities/ABC, making Oprah Winfrey the first woman in history to own and produce her own talk show. \r\n\r\nOprah Winfrey's business interests have extended well beyond her own production company. She is one of the partners in Oxygen Media, Inc., a cable channel and interactive network presenting programming designed primarily for women. With her success, she has also become one of the world's most generous philanthropists. In 2000, Oprah's Angel Network began presenting a $100,000 \"Use Your Life Award\" to people who are using their own lives to improve the lives of others. She now publishes two magazines, O, The Oprah Magazine, and O at Home. The launch of her first magazine was the most successful start-up in the history of the industry. When Forbes published its list of America's billionaires for the year 2003, it disclosed that Oprah Winfrey was the first African-American woman to become a billionaire. \r\n\r\nIn a 2010 interview on the Larry King program at the end of that year, she announced her decision to end her run on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The final broadcast took place on May 25, 2011, after 24 seasons and over 5,000 broadcasts. The end of the syndicated program was not the end of Oprah Winfrey's broadcasting career.
